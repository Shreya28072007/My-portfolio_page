About me in short-<br>
<br>
Hello! I am Shreya, an 8th grader, a whitehat coder, a byjute, a calligra friend, a movies lover, an elder sister and a lover of lame jokes.<br>
Not a nerd kinda person but being enthusiastic about everything is a kind of hobby in me.<br>
I love football and brain-freeze drinks accompanied with lameness.Enjoying everything to the fullest with hardship<br>
and movies.</p>
